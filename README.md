# Overview

- Mining is the process of trying to earn crypto. It is currently taking the world by storm as everyone is trying to learn how to mine cryptocurrencies.

- Ebitcoiner (Cloud mining System) is a method that allows everyday investors who may lack sufficient technical knowledge to mine cryptocurrencies. It reduces overall costs associated with mining.

- With Ebitcoiner, investors can purchase the hashing power. They can rent crypto mining hardware that can achieve the desired hash rate at a certain market price without dealing with heat, noise problems, and government issues (it is illegal in some countries).

- The system enables users to build and control a mining business from home without bothering themselves with the whole process.

- A user dashboard is implemented that helps the investors to buy and control their hash rate plans or their mining devices.

- The investors will be able to deposit or withdraw funds and watch all the transactions in a table.

- An Admin dashboard is implemented for adding, editing, or deleting plans for the users.

- The admin accepts the userâ€™s buying or booking requests.
